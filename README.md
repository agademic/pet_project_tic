# Pet Project for Advanced Software Engineering WS 2018/19

My pet project for Advanced Software Engineering was inspired by a kaggle notebook. It is a Reinforcement Learning program for the game Tic Tac Toe. The program creates a neural network model for turn evaluations and is trained while playing against a programmed opponent. In the end a user can play against the trained model. In this documentation I will show UML diagrams and some metrics for the code, as well as some clean code concepts.

# UML diagrams

Following UML diagram shows the connection of all modules for the program.
